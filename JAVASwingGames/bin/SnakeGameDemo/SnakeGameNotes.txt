This project was for me to learn how to make a game following OOP

What I learned
	In the past I made a hangman game in pythton. This showed me how much better OOP 
	is when it comes to readable code. Making the tile class to control the length of
	the snake body and the food should me an easy way to create a list of objects.
	
	This was my first project using Swing / AWT, so I learned about method calls.
	Also how JFrame is a top window and the JPanel is a lower window. 
	
	This was the first time using listeners. I learned how to create my own methods
	by overriding the parent class.
